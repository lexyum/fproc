1) Layers of abstraction
=========================
1.1) Individual sequences

An individual sequence is stored as a struct `gene_seq_t',
which is declared in <geneseq.h> as:

struct gene_seq_t {
       char *label;
       char *sequence;

       /* other fields */
       char *strand;
       long unsigned int min;
       long unsigned int max;
};

The first two fields are completely general and must be filled
for any valid FASTA file. If the FASTA file contains additional
information in the deflines this may be stored in further fields,
but the code to handle these is necessarily dependent on the
convention used in the FASTA files.

TO DO: replace other fields by a generic `metadata' field, for
       ease of modification for other FASTA conventions.
       Maybe store unmodified defline and define an interpretation
       function for each convention?

1.2) FASTA file

An individual FASTA file is represented by a binary tree with a
sequence associated to each leaf. Each leaf is represented internally
by a struct `gene_node_t':

struct gene_node_t {
       struct gene_seq_t *gene_seq;
       struct gene_node_t *right;
       struct gene_node_t *left;
};

NOTE: `gene_node_t' could be defined to include all the fields of
       gene_seq, 
is performed by acting on a struct `gene_tree_t', defined in
<genetree.h> as

struct gene_tree_t {
       char *filename;

       unsigned int size;
       struct gene_node_t *root;
};
